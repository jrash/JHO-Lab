Major changes to chemmodlab:
     -finished function documentation
     -can plot a subset of accumulation curve plots now
     -plots of accumulation curves look a bit different
          -should we change to plotting every curve at x=0, y=0?
     -more intuitive specification of descriptor sets
          -making another function that will take descriptor sets as a list of dataframes
     -added example dataset
          -reduced sample size so code will run faster (removed large number of inactives)
          -can access when package is loaded
